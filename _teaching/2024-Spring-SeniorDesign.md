#Overall Description

[see details.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WkM3TWNvVBtJfX6Al_4_xWi224NkJsmkLir3FjT__T4/edit#heading=h.taq6zgi07x3t)
This course project involves the comprehensive creation of a full-scale infrastructure designed specifically to support and enhance the functionality of a basic application. You will be engaged in hands-on experience from the very beginning, starting with the foundational task of building and configuring hardware components, such as Raspberry Pi and Jetson Nano. This will include the formation of a small yet efficient cluster, designed to demonstrate the principles and practices of connected hardware systems in a real-world scenario.

Moving beyond the hardware aspects, the project will also delve into the realm of containerization. You'll gain practical skills in setting up, deploying, and managing containers, which are essential for creating a flexible, scalable, and isolated environment for applications. This aspect of the project is intended to give you a deep understanding of modern software deployment strategies and the dynamics of container orchestration platforms.

A key component of this project is the development and implementation of a streamlined stream processing application. This application will be specifically designed to capture and process data in real time. You'll learn how to handle continuous data streams, implementing techniques to efficiently process, analyze, and store data for future retrieval and use. This experience will not only provide you with valuable insights into data handling and processing but will also prepare you for the challenges of dealing with big data in a professional environment.
