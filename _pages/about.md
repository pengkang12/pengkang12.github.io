About Me
====
I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Computer science](https://cs.utsa.edu/) at the University of Texas at San Antonio, where I have the fortune of being supervised by Dr. [Palden Lama](http://www.cs.utsa.edu/~plama/). 

My research focuses on designing advanced system software and middleware solutions to optimize cloud and edge resource management, enhancing the Quality of Service for end users. These solutions are grounded on the principles of probabilistic machine learning, Bayesian optimization and game theory. 

I enjoy communicating my work and talking with students who want to learn more about computer science. Please don't hesitate to reach out!
